# Assignment Question:In-Memory File System

1. `mkdir`: Create a new directory.
2. `cd`: Changes the current directory. Support navigating to the parent directory using `..`, moving to the root directory using `/`, and navigating to a specified absolute path. Basically anything that you can do in a normal terminal. Since there is no user level implementation, ~ and / should take you to root.
3. `ls`: List the contents of the current directory or a specified directory.
4. `grep`: Search for a specified pattern in a file. **PS: Its a bonus**
5. `cat`: Display the contents of a file.
6. `touch`: Create a new empty file.
7. `echo`: Write text to a file. ex - `echo 'I am "Finding" difficult to write this to file' > file.txt`
8. `mv`: Move a file or directory to another location. ex - `mv /data/ice_cream/cassata.txt ./data/boring/ice_cream/mississippimudpie/`
